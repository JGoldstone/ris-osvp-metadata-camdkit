    <h1>OpenTrackIO Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>OpenTrackIO is a free and open protocol designed by the RIS OSVP SMPTE group that seeks to improve interoperability in Virtual Production encoding, tracking and robotic systems.</p>
    <p>This documentation is designed for those producing and consuming tracking data.</p>
    <p>OpenTrackIO defines static and dynamic JSON samples that contain a wide range of metadata about the device, its transform(s), camera and lens.</p>
    <p>All the fields described should be considered optional by the consumer (although for high-quality tracking see the recommended set in the samples below).</p>
    <p>OpenTrackIO employs the OpenLensIO mathematical model for the practical application of lens distortion in Virtual Production.</p>
    
    <h2>Static Sample</h2>
    <p>It is recommended that a static metadata sample is transmitted approximately every 2 seconds. It describes the metadata context of the dynamic samples that follow, with data that may change - for example - every take, but will not change every frame.</p>
    <h3>Recommended minimum VP static example</h3>
    <code>{{examples.recommended_static_example}}</code>
    <h3>Complete example sample</h3>
    <code>{{examples.complete_static_example}}</code>
    
    <h2>Dynamic Sample</h2>
    <p>It is recommended that dynamic metadata samples are transmitted every frame (i.e. to coincide with the video frames from a camera). It provides a snapshot of the status of the tracking system at that instant.</p>
    <h3>Recommended minimum VP dynamic example</h3>
    <code>{{examples.recommended_dynamic_example}}</code>
    <h3>Complete example sample</h3>
    <code>{{examples.complete_dynamic_example}}</code>

    <h2>Transport Recommendations</h2>
    <p>TODO</p>

    <h2>JSON Schema</h2>
    <p>The full documentation of every field is presented as a JSON schema:</p>
    <h3>Static sample JSON schema</h3>
    <code>{{static_schema}}</code>
    <h3>Dynamic sample JSON schema</h3>
    <code>{{dynamic_schema}}</code>
